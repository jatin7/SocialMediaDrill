Surveillance cameras don't work, and when they do the quality of the video is so poor you can't really get a good picture of suspects. So, what kind of crime deterrent is that, when the criminals know the video quality is bad.  The PA system in the subway is the most ridiculous sound system ever.  95\u0025 of the time I can't understand what they are saying. If there were some emergency, and we were instructed to do something, I wouldn't know what to do.  Also, I find that the MTA conductors, token booth clerks and MTA workers on the platform often don't know what is happening during a delay or police investigation.  This is very scary.  Not only is the communication process messed up for commuters, but it is also messed up for  MTA employees. The internal communication process of the MTA is frightening.  The left hand does not know what the right hand is doing.  I also, find the subway seats and the interior of subway cars to be filthy.  The cars smell bad, and often homeless people ride them. Sometimes when there is a seat, I do not sit, because the seat is so dirty. Can we say the spread of disease is possible in this type of setting. I do not feel safe at all on the subway.  I do research for a living.  So, I know that the crime statistics you provide commuters with are skewed.  If we knew the real crime statistics we would be terrified to commute.","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"10154043349574091_10154048497689091"},{"created_time":"2016-09-23T21:50:41+0000","from":{"name":"Joseph Casado","id":"1197335840324113"},"message":"And we go as fkn usual instead of the 5 train running express  to Neri ed likes it suppose to it go local and the fkn moron conductor on train 6311 didn't make any announcement  ,which is odd how it goes local when you have a,2 train directly in front of it as well right behind it , another fkn crappy ass commute provided by assess of the mta , maybe people need to start doing to the mta what they doing in Chicago and Charlotte, these fn people need to get the pic that riders of fed up already","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"10154043349574091_10154048932634091"},{"created_time":"2016-09-27T12:41:26+0000","from":{"name":"Joseph Casado","id":"1197335840324113"},"message":"I think people should start using the red button in the train cars every time the train is just sitting there , especially of the conductor doesn't make any announcement it's time we take back our commute and start showing the mta who actually pays them","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"10154043349574091_10154058630929091"},{"created_time":"2016-09-21T19:12:58+0000","from":{"name":"Jeremy Freed","id":"10154866191116412"},"message":"How about spending some of that money on fixing the tracks, the signal system, and everything else that craps out and turns rush hour into a disaster?","can_remove":false,"like_count":4,"user_likes":false,"id":"10154043349574091_10154043386894091"},{"created_time":"2016-10-06T23:06:27+0000","from":{"name":"Nadia Germain","id":"925645240904175"},"message":"Half hour to hour and a half  wait for a bus \nA five minute train ride takes half hour to a hour the buses and subways are in degatory conditions and yet they raising fare saying the don't have and yet billion dollar projects that can be put on hold for a bit the money they have for that","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"10154043349574091_10154083364884091"},{"created_time":"2016-10-10T16:33:55+0000","from":{"name":"Timothy John Mulholland","id":"10207662657511944"},"message":"Fix the subway service never mind tge look of the stations you all remind me of the Kardashians outside looks good but inside and down below you are dumb, trashy,filthy,sticky,oh and WET ALL OVER.","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"10154043349574091_10154093218564091"},{"created_time":"2016-09-23T12:47:06+0000","from":{"name":"Colleen Myers","id":"10210442276310990"},"message":"BX 24 bus that should arrive in country club at 9am has not left hutchinson station yet, that means everyone waiting this bus will be late.","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"10154043349574091_10154047730519091"},{"created_time":"2016-09-22T05:44:38+0000","from":{"name":"Jason Fuentes","id":"203419590069380"},"message":"It would be nice if you fix every station take out the homeless people new track,train,the signal problem more elevator you how hard is to mother with a new born baby to go up and down stairs that is not easy so get to work on that please.","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"10154043349574091_10154044628594091"},{"created_time":"2016-09-22T09:40:53+0000","from":{"name":"Jaime Pimentel","id":"10211115611471747"},"message":"How about improve service on the 4 5 &6 lines keep 4 as express at all times in Manhattan #wedeservebetter","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"10154043349574091_10154044903764091"},{"created_time":"2016-09-21T21:33:53+0000","from":{"name":"Nick A.

By that time many passengers were already very anxious and confused about the situation . As I took a picture of the confused people running around in the station an mta employee attacked me and threatened me that she would call police and have me arrested if I don't stop taking pictures of her. I explained that I am a journalist and that I have a right to take pictures by NYC laws. She got worse!!!

At approx 10 PM today Aug 10-th , I arrived at the bus stop \u0040 7-th Ave\/57 St and saw the bus still there . With the doors closed though . Went by the door and waved to the driver . He waved back with a move which I can only interpret as \"whatever\" , or \"wait for the next bus \" ( probably 30 min later at that hour ! ) or even \"F*** you\" since he did NOT BOTHER to open the doors for me and flew from right under my nose , more preoccupied to make the traffic light across 7-th Ave ( 9 sec left at that point ) . this is how you treat passengers ? Leaving a woman alone in a bus stop at night ? As it was late already and the neighborhood didn't seem safe ( lots of homeless people begging or sleeping around there ) , I took a cab home ( $ 13.80 with tip ) , so I have spend $ 11 more than what I was planning to spend , since I've charged my Metrocard specifically for this type of trips . I use M31 quite frequently , being close to my building . Usually the drivers are very nice and helpful . Not this one though . I'm sure you know who was working the shift that night but for the record , it appeared to me a middle-aged Caucasian male , with an obnoxious face . I will post about this over Social Media - twitter , Facebook , as much as I can , I am too frustrated.
